GHAZAL: ROSES 

I know this book by heart, don't keep me waiting

Turn, o tardy season, to the page of roses 

The trope may be tired but my pen flows fresh 

Let it rain once more with the coinage of roses

You are a noisy mile, mired in mine fields of words

Nâz is stillness distilled, a silent age of roses

(c) Sophia Pandeya, aka "Nâz"
